### Open Projects at DEIL

#### Exploring the potential of open data using an “open project” approach

#### Speaker

Data Exploration and Integration Lab Team, Centre for Special Business Project, Statistics Canada

#### Format

Workshop

#### Description

Over the last few years, the Data Exploration and Integration Lab (DEIL) at Statistics Canada has conducted an increasing amount of work using various open source tools, open data, and open code. For instance, since 2016, DEIL has implemented tools and project solutions on its GitHub account, providing and sharing code under an open source license. In January 2018, DEIL began exploring the potential of integrating open data into coherent and standardized datasets. This exploration and experience has given rise to the idea of using an “open project” approach.

This workshop will engage the audience with practical examples of “open projects”, that is, projects that, to the extent possible, make use of open software, open code, Open Standards, open data, and open project management tools. The focus will be on the integration of buildings and business records, using exclusively open microdata. The preliminary results obtained to date are very encouraging and more can be achieved in a collaborative environment.

The workshop will discuss the potential and benefits of working as an open project, the challenges that are encountered and the possible solutions. For instance, some of the integration solutions are developed in Python and the GNU/Linux operating system to allow for a more fluid development platform, which was found to simplify the data processing framework. Availability and accuracy of the data will be also discussed. An open project framework permits all participants to actively engage in the current and future development of the ongoing work. The session will provide simple hands-on examples on how to contribute to such initiatives.
