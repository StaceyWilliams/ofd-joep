## Purpose

Following the redaction of the [Open First Whitepaper](https://github.com/canada-ca/Open_First_Whitepaper/blob/master/README.md), the Open First Day will highlight how the Government of Canada has been and will continue adopting Open Standards, using and contributing to Open Source Software, thus supporting an open culture and open markets.

Government of Canada departments have been working openly and in collaboration with the population as well as with private companies to enhance the quality of their service offerings for all Canadians using Open Source Software and Open Standards.

This day will provide an opportunity for the various actors of the public service, private sector and the population to discuss and engage together in order to exchange on the progress made over the last years and how we can continue to add value to our activities and services together.

## Format of the day

The Open First Day will offer a wide variety of activities and sessions for participants to learn and engage with other government employees as well as with private sector representatives and members of the public.

In order to help capture the breadth of what is in scope, we have put together multiple streams.

The first stream is the general, or "executive", stream which is geared towards a higher level view of what Open Government is; how we can use and contribute to Open Source Software and how we can actually procure such technologies.

Then, there are three more specific streams with sessions where engagement with the participants will be privileged.

- The Rules stream will have a session around the legislative clarifications and guidance on the use and contribution to Open Source Software.
- The Tools stream will offer sessions around the decentralized version control system Git and how it is possible to leverage Open Source Software at every layer of an application.
- The People stream will explore the work done by various departments in terms of crowdsourcing and open collaboration as well as how Open Source Software can be leveraged in such initiatives.

For the people who are already familiar with these concepts, a series of networking activities will be held during the day to help support a greater cohesion of the community of practice as well as the external service providers. Such activities include an Unconference stream, speed networking sessions, lunchtime and after event mixing.

### Open Projects at DEIL

#### Exploring the potential of open data using an “open project” approach

#### Speaker

Data Exploration and Integration Lab Team, Centre for Special Business Project, Statistics Canada

#### Format

Workshop

#### Description

Over the last few years, the Data Exploration and Integration Lab (DEIL) at Statistics Canada has conducted an increasing amount of work using various open source tools, open data, and open code. For instance, since 2016, DEIL has implemented tools and project solutions on its GitHub account, providing and sharing code under an open source license. In January 2018, DEIL began exploring the potential of integrating open data into coherent and standardized datasets. This exploration and experience has given rise to the idea of using an “open project” approach.

This workshop will engage the audience with practical examples of “open projects”, that is, projects that, to the extent possible, make use of open software, open code, Open Standards, open data, and open project management tools. The focus will be on the integration of buildings and business records, using exclusively open microdata. The preliminary results obtained to date are very encouraging and more can be achieved in a collaborative environment.

The workshop will discuss the potential and benefits of working as an open project, the challenges that are encountered and the possible solutions. For instance, some of the integration solutions are developed in Python and the GNU/Linux operating system to allow for a more fluid development platform, which was found to simplify the data processing framework. Availability and accuracy of the data will be also discussed. An open project framework permits all participants to actively engage in the current and future development of the ongoing work. The session will provide simple hands-on examples on how to contribute to such initiatives.
